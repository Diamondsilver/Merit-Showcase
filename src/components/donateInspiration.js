          After earning merits through your hard work, they can be spent in the
          school shop. Another way merits can be paid is by donating it to a
          charity. When you send tokens to one of the charities below, your
          token is saved and taken count off. Each token sent to a charity will
          be backed by Â£1 which will be paid by the school at the end of the
          academic year!
